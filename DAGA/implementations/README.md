# DAGA Dataset
This folder contains the implementations of DAGA. Each implementation is released in a separate folder:
 - ```BinaryLookup```: Implementation of DAGA based on the binary lookup algorithm;
 - ```Hashmap```: Implementation of DAGA based on the Hashmap data structure;
 - ```Trie```: Implementation of DAGA based on a custom memory-optimized data structure.

For a detailed explanation of the different implementations, please refer to the original paper.
